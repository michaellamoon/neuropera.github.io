  <p class="NDes">Do you hear the people sing is a song from Les Miserable,
    lyrics rewritten by Menghe Jing and Paul Berkold. This project is
    created to show people that musicians are still working on our area even
     though our stages are our own bedrooms. Everyone can fight on as well! </p>

  <br>Do you hear the people sing,
<br>Singing the song of quarantine?
<br>It is the music of a people
<br>Who will sing in front of a screen.
<br>Covid can pop up suddenly,
<br>We never know when that time will be,
<br>Still in our hearts we sing with glee,
<br>‘Til the virus is gone!

<br><br>Will you join the masked army,
<br>Eat at home ‘til groceries are done?
<br>Remain in place for work and play
<br>Make sure that you are all alone?
<br>Then sing for the fight
<br>To do what is right ‘til it’s won?!

<br><br>Do you hear the people sing,
<br>Singing the song of quarantine?
<br>It is the music of a people
<br>Who will sing in front of a screen.
<br>Covid can pop up suddenly,
<br>We never know when that time will be,
<br>Still in our hearts we sing with glee,
<br>‘Til the virus is gone!

<br><br>Wash your hands and keep your distance from me
<br>Even when you sleep.
<br>With less contact we can soon back
<br>And sing ASAP!
<br>Imagine the trapping
<br>Of hearing handclapping for real!
