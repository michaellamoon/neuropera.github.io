  <h3 class="T"> Project Description </h3>
  <p class="NDes">Inspired by the performace given by Maureen in Rent, I am taking the lyrics to "Over the Moon"
    and making it more modern. This would discuss today's problems with gentrification and the patriarchy, and
    possibly about the pandemic. It's describing a dream that is had where Maureen, and now me, are sent to a
    land where nothing is "real" and everything has been turned into virtual life and the greedy society
    standards due to humanity crashing down and those who have bowed down to these changes and tearing down life
    and art as we know it. The only way out is to jump over the moon- which could be idealized as the calming
    equilibrium that humanity needs to heal and whats needed to see and appreciate the idea that gentrification
    is ruining our wolrd, not saving it. There is a section at the end that I am changing to create a mashup in
    a way. I will be tagging on the Finale B of Rent to the end of this to bring in the idea of hummanity,
    community, and the idea of living in the now and full of love. I'm hoping to immulate the original
    performance visually- not exactly sure what I am adding to it yet for my own personal flare, but I will have
    that laid out this week</p>
