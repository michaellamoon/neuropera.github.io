  <p class="NDes">
    Inspired and modernized by the Broadway show Rent, Over the Moon
    discusses today's problems with gentrification and the patriarchy
    in a dream-like setting. In this dream world, humanity is lost and
    there is no love or creativity. The only way out is to jump over the
    moon, which is where life in general is full of community, love, and
    acceptance.</p>
<p class="NDes" style="margin-left: 20vw;">
    <br>Last night, I had a dream
<br>I found myself in a desert called MAGAland
<br>It was hot
<br>My canteen had sprung a leak and I was thirsty
<br>Out of the abyss walked a cow, Elsey
<br>I asked if she had anything to drink she said
<br>I'm forbidden to produce milk
<br>In MAGAland we only drink
<br>Diet Coke (Diet Coke Diet Coke)
<br>She said
<br>Only thing to do is jump over the moon
<br>They've closed everything real down like barns and troughs and
<br>Performance spaces
<br>And replaced it all with lies and fake news and
<br>Virtual life
<br>But there is a way out (leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith)
<br>Ooh
<br>"Only thing to do is jump over the moon"
<br>I gotta get outta here
<br>It's like I'm being tied to the hood of a confederate pick-up truck
<br>Being packed in with fertilizer and fuel oil pushed over a cliff by a suicidal Trump-loving louse
<br>I've gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta find a way
<br>To jump over the moon only thing to do is jump over the moon
<br>Then a little bulldog entered
<br>His name we have learned is Uncle Sam
<br>And although he once had principals he abandoned them
<br>To live as a lapdog to the wealthy, whiny members of the G.O.P
<br>A one two three "That's fake news" he said
<br>"Ever since the elephant took up the fiddle the donkeyâ€™s been
<br>Jumpy
<br>The dish and the spoon were evicted from the table and eloped
<br>She's had trouble with that milk and the moon ever since maybe it's a
<br>Female thing
<br>Cause who'd wanna leave MAGAland anyway?
<br>Building Walls ain't so bad
<br>The dish and the spoon for instance
<br>They're down on their luck they come knockin' on my doghouse door and I say
<br>'Not in my backyard Covid
<br>Go back to China'"
<br>(Bi-di-bong)
<br>"The only way out is up"
<br>Elsie whispered to me
<br>"A leap of
<br>Faith"
<br>"Still thirsty?"
<br>"Parched"
<br>"Have some milk"
<br>And I lowered myself beneath her swollen udder
<br>And sucked the sweetest milk I had ever tasted
<br>"Climb on board"
<br>She said
<br>And as a harvest moon rose over MAGAland
<br>We reared back we sprang into a gallop, leaping, out of orbit, and I awoke singing
<br>(Leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith)
<br>Ooh only thing to do
<br>Only thing to do is jump
<br>Only thing to do is jump over the moon
<br>Only thing to do is jump over the moon
<br>Over the moon
<br>And that's when I realized
<br>Humanity can be saved
<br>In love and in the now
<br>As long as we come together and live
<br>We can create a world that will be stronger
<br>And more beautiful than ever
<br>Afterall..

<br><br>All
<br>There's only us
<br>There's only this
<br>Forget regret or
<br>Life is yours to miss
<br>No other road no other way
<br>No day but today

<br><br>Part 1
<br>I can't control
<br>I trust my soul
<br>My destiny
<br>My only goal

<br><br>Part 2
<br>Will I lose my dignity
<br>Will someone care
<br>Will I wake tomorrow
<br>From this nightmare

<br><br>Part 1
<br>Is just to be
<br>Without
<br>You
<br>The hand gropes
<br>The ear hears
<br>The pulse beats
<br>Life goes on
<br>But I'm gone

<br><br>Part 2
<br>There's only now
<br>There's only here
<br>Give in to love
<br>Or live in fear
<br>No other path
<br>No other way

<br><br>Part 1
<br>'Cause I die
<br>Without you
<br>I die without you
<br>I die without you
<br>I die without you
<br>I die without you
<br>I die without you

<br><br>Part 2
<br>No day but today
<br>No day but today
<br>No day but today
<br>No day but today
<br>No day but today
<br>No day but today
<br>ALL
<br>NO DAY BUT TODAY!!
