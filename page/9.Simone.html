  <p class="NDes">Come Sail Away is a working through of grief and familial bonds.
    In 2018 the artistâ€™s aunt, who was schizophrenic, died suddenly of colon cancer.
     Adapted from the 1977 song by Styx, Come Sail Away incorporates polyvocality,
     medical records and X-ray images, and tarot as testimony to the persistence of
     life after loss.   </p>

        <br>To carry ten wands : this lyric is a we
        <br>Reframed 	I pull
        <br>Her figure through the form of the state
        <br>The woman we love
        <br>Buried by dalliance
        <br>Of organized abandonment
        <br>To carry ten wands : this lyric is a we
        <br>Reframed 	Infection
        <br>at the sutures of grief	Voice
        <br>begins with inhale 		shakes
        <br>the throat from its margin	fills
        <br>The void into wave		defines
        <br>A way between teeth 	Voice
        <br>Is the gesture of power
        <br>Of fury of presence of love
        <br>I trace her absence from these waters
        <br>This sound is the language of storm
        <br>To carry ten wands :

        <br><br>I'm sailing away
        <br>Set an open course for the Virgin Sea
        <br>'Cause I've got to be free
        <br>Free to face the life that's ahead of me
        <br>On board I'm the captain
        <br>So climb aboard
        <br>We'll search for tomorrow
        <br>On every shore and I'll try
        <br>Oh Lord I'll try
        <br>To carry on

        <br>I look to the sea
        <br>Reflections in the waves spark my memory
        <br>Some happy some sad
        <br>I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
        <br>We live happily forever
        <br>So the story goes
        <br>But somehow we missed out
        <br>On that pot of gold
        <br>But we'll try best that we can
        <br>To carry on

        <br>A gathering of angels
        <br>Appeared above my head
        <br>They sang to me this song of hope
        <br>And this is what they said
        <br>They said, come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me

        <br><br>I thought that they were angels
        <br>But to my surprise
        <br>We climbed aboard their starship
        <br>We headed for the skies
        <br>Singing, come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
        <br>Come sail away, come sail away
        <br>Come sail away with me
